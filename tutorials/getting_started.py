# Modelling means explaining what we observe using things we want to know. For example, we may be interested in how a cell differentiates, and thus create a model in which we try to explain the transcriptomes of many differentiating cells based on a model of gene dynamics along differentiation.

# Each model contains several known and unknown variables. We will first look at the main types of variables that are contained within a model. We will then investigate
