    "Why model data? You as a user probably have either of two goals in mind: prediction or understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **prediction**, we mainly care about make generalizable models. Generalizability means we want a model that not only works on the cells we just killed in an experiment, but also want to make good predictions about any future cells (and ideally, patients). When predicting, we typically do not care much about interpretability. However, just like we often want to know the mechanism of a potential drug, having an interpretable model can also be useful when making predictions.\n",

    "  - Require a bit more data, because there are more free parameters\n",

Although latenta may make this easier, it would be unwise to completely abstract away every mathematical concept. Some probability, statistics and machine learning concepts are simply too central for modelling (and, in fact, biology!) to hide. In these tutorials, we often refer you to relevant \"explanation\" resources (denoted by a see also sign) where you can improve your understanding of some of these concepts."
